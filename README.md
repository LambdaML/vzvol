# vzvol
vzvol is a tool to assist in the creation of ZFS zvols as storage for various virtualization providers.

## What
Creates a ZFS zvol, configures permissions, and then creates and registers a VirtualBox VMDK shim for the zvol. 

## Why
This allows you to use the zvol to back a disk for VirtualBox.
